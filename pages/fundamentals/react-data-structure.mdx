# Data Structure in React
In this part we will go through the data structure in React, including `FiberRoot`, `Fiber`, `effectTags`, `ReactWorkTag`, `sideEffects`, `Update` and `UpdateQueue` and compare both the latest version and the version on v16.

## FiberRoot


### V18
```typescript
type BaseFiberRootProperties = {
  // The type of root (legacy, batched, concurrent, etc.)
  tag: RootTag,

  // Any additional information from the host associated with this root.
  containerInfo: Container,
  // Used only by persistent updates.
  pendingChildren: any,
  // The currently active root fiber. This is the mutable root of the tree.
  current: Fiber,

  pingCache: WeakMap<Wakeable, Set<mixed>> | Map<Wakeable, Set<mixed>> | null,

  // A finished work-in-progress HostRoot that's ready to be committed.
  finishedWork: Fiber | null,
  // Timeout handle returned by setTimeout. Used to cancel a pending timeout, if
  // it's superseded by a new one.
  timeoutHandle: TimeoutHandle | NoTimeout,
  // When a root has a pending commit scheduled, calling this function will
  // cancel it.
  // TODO: Can this be consolidated with timeoutHandle?
  cancelPendingCommit: null | (() => void),
  // Top context object, used by renderSubtreeIntoContainer
  context: Object | null,
  pendingContext: Object | null,

  // Used to create a linked list that represent all the roots that have
  // pending work scheduled on them.
  next: FiberRoot | null,

  // Node returned by Scheduler.scheduleCallback. Represents the next rendering
  // task that the root will work on.
  callbackNode: any,
  callbackPriority: Lane,
  expirationTimes: LaneMap<number>,
  hiddenUpdates: LaneMap<Array<ConcurrentUpdate> | null>,

  pendingLanes: Lanes,
  suspendedLanes: Lanes,
  pingedLanes: Lanes,
  expiredLanes: Lanes,
  errorRecoveryDisabledLanes: Lanes,
  shellSuspendCounter: number,

  finishedLanes: Lanes,

  entangledLanes: Lanes,
  entanglements: LaneMap<Lanes>,

  pooledCache: Cache | null,
  pooledCacheLanes: Lanes,

  // TODO: In Fizz, id generation is specific to each server config. Maybe we
  // should do this in Fiber, too? Deferring this decision for now because
  // there's no other place to store the prefix except for an internal field on
  // the public createRoot object, which the fiber tree does not currently have
  // a reference to.
  identifierPrefix: string,

  onRecoverableError: (
    error: mixed,
    errorInfo: {digest?: ?string, componentStack?: ?string},
  ) => void,

  formState: ReactFormState<any, any> | null,
};

```
### V16 
```typescript
type BaseFiberRootProperties = {|
  // it's a node in root, second argument of render
  containerInfo: any,
  // only being used in persisted updates( aka doesn't support incremental updates), neither used in react-dom
  pendingChildren: any,
  // current target fiber, the root of the tree
  current: Fiber,

  // Below code are used for separating priorities of tasks 
  // 1) Task that are not commited
  // 2) Suspence that are not committed
  // 3) Suspence that might be committed later
  // To improve performance, it chose to not trace every single blocking registration 
  // The earliest and latest priority levels that are suspended from committing.
  // The earlist and latest tasks that are await for rendering

  earliestSuspendedTime: ExpirationTime,
  latestSuspendedTime: ExpirationTime,

  // The earliest and latest priority levels that are not known to be suspended.
  // The earliest and latest tasks that are pending/unsure of the render（The initial state of all the tasks when they come in）
  earliestPendingTime: ExpirationTime,
  latestPendingTime: ExpirationTime,

  // The latest priority level that was pinged by a resolved promise and can
  // be retried.
  // The least priority that can be resolved via a promise
  latestPingedTime: ExpirationTime,

  // If there are error being thrown, and there are no further updates, it will try to rendering from the start before handling the error 
  // if there are errors that can't be handled at `renderRoot`, this `didError` will be marked as `true` 
  didError: boolean,

  // `expirationTime` of the task that are await to be committed 
  pendingCommitExpirationTime: ExpirationTime,

  //  The FiberRoot target that already finished rendering, if you only have one root, then it will always be the fiber in this Root, or it is null 
  // During commit phase, React will only handle the task related to `finishedWord`
  finishedWork: Fiber | null,

  // The returned result when the tasks are being handled by `setTimeout`, when there is a next new task it will trigger the timeout yet to be cleaned up
  timeoutHandle: TimeoutHandle | NoTimeout,

  // Top level context, it will only be used when `renderSubtreeIntoContainer` 
  context: Object | null,
  pendingContext: Object | null,

  // Used to make sure if the first render needs hydration
  +hydrate: boolean,

  // The rest of expirationTime in current root
  // TODO: explain how the renderer separate the target to handle
  nextExpirationTimeToWorkOn: ExpirationTime,
  
  // The current expirationTime's expirationTime
  expirationTime: ExpirationTime,

  // List of top-level batches. This list indicates whether a commit should be
  // deferred. Also contains completion callbacks.
  // TODO: Lift this into the renderer
  firstBatch: Batch | null,

  // How the Roots are related -> to handle the next root
  nextScheduledRoot: FiberRoot | null,
|};
```

#### Changes 
- adding `tag` to specify the type of root 
- Improve performance: separate suspended time are removed and handled better by `Lane`, `expirationTimes` and `callbackPriority`
- Better error handling: remove `didError` as boolean, and make them `onRecoverable Error` with specific error information

#### Changes

##### Clean up
1. Specifically cleaning up after `ref`. If clean up function is not provided, `ref` function [is called with null](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/e98225485a124e35abc4cea82e6da944472ce7c7) like it has been before. 
2. [Remove `_debugID`](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/0d493dcda96fc86242cf9a05a44130978a56fbdd) and `_debugSource` fields as they are not really needed and adds costs but adds `_debugHookTypes` for hooks and a boolean `_debugNeedsRemount` for quick debug status confirmation.

##### Clearer naming and separations 
1. `firstContextDependency` is now `dependencies` 
2. `effectTags` is now separated into `flags`, `subtreeFlags` and `deletions`. See [Effects list refactor](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/a226b9b44591e2af85388fa88ddf76b3f3a9de6c#diff-d1a3ea99997381524bfbed5c008aa456ee10f8e773d027d94acb1a37f416e872) and [combine flags and subtreeFlags](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/7baf9d4128d41903de125527b50285ea9862cf9a) whilst the effect algorithm is unchanged. 
3. `expirationTime` is now `lanes` and `childExpirationTime` is now `childLanes`. Consequently Andrew simplifies them by [splitting the types](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/376d5c1b5aa17724c5fea9412f8fcde14a7b23f1) and then [make expirationTime an opaque type](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/db6513914f99c260090f26f0a547ee1432c934e6) in order to replace previous scheduler work in reconciler, as a more apparent way of how tasks are being queued.

#### Changes
[V18](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberFlags.js) renamed `ReactSideEffectTags` to `ReactFiberFlags` (ReactFiberFlags) to broaden fiber types. The contants in the old [ReactSideEffectTags](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5d9f5e5941587e0c72ecfb7b76f1849a95e93f8a/packages/shared/ReactSideEffectTags.js) used bitwise operations to efficiently track and manage the effects of updates to the virtual DOM + prevent app crashing/bailout. `effectTags` and `sideEffects` are consolidated into one file `FiberFlags`.


And yes, running out of bits in React is a real fucking risk. 

## ReactWorkTag


### V18 
```typescript
export const FunctionComponent = 0;
export const ClassComponent = 1;
export const IndeterminateComponent = 2; // Before we know whether it is function or class
export const HostRoot = 3; // Root of a host tree. Could be nested inside another node.
export const HostPortal = 4; // A subtree. Could be an entry point to a different renderer.
export const HostComponent = 5;
export const HostText = 6;
export const Fragment = 7;
export const Mode = 8;
export const ContextConsumer = 9;
export const ContextProvider = 10;
export const ForwardRef = 11;
export const Profiler = 12;
export const SuspenseComponent = 13;
export const MemoComponent = 14;
export const SimpleMemoComponent = 15;
export const LazyComponent = 16;
export const IncompleteClassComponent = 17;
export const DehydratedFragment = 18;
export const SuspenseListComponent = 19;
export const ScopeComponent = 21;
export const OffscreenComponent = 22;
export const LegacyHiddenComponent = 23;
export const CacheComponent = 24;
export const TracingMarkerComponent = 25;
export const HostHoistable = 26;
export const HostSingleton = 27;
```


### V16 
```typescript

export const FunctionComponent = 0;
export const ClassComponent = 1;
export const IndeterminateComponent = 2; // Before we know whether it is function or class
export const HostRoot = 3; // Root of a host tree. Could be nested inside another node.
export const HostPortal = 4; // A subtree. Could be an entry point to a different renderer.
export const HostComponent = 5;
export const HostText = 6;
export const Fragment = 7;
export const Mode = 8;
export const ContextConsumer = 9;
export const ContextProvider = 10;
export const ForwardRef = 11;
export const Profiler = 12;
export const SuspenseComponent = 13;
export const MemoComponent = 14;
export const SimpleMemoComponent = 15;
export const LazyComponent = 16;
export const IncompleteClassComponent = 17;
```

#### Changes  
The new version added `DehydratedFragment`, `SuspenseListComponent`, `ScopeComponent`, `OffscreenComponent`, `LegacyHiddenComponent`, `CacheComponent`, `TracingMarkerComponent`, `HostHoistable`, `HostSingleton` to the list of `ReactWorkTag`. We will talk about some of them (ex: `SuspenseListComponent`) in the later section. 


## Update & UpdateQueue 


### V18 


```typescript
export type Update<State> = {
  lane: Lane,

  tag: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3,
  payload: any,
  callback: (() => mixed) | null,

  next: Update<State> | null,
};

export type SharedQueue<State> = {
  pending: Update<State> | null,
  lanes: Lanes,
  hiddenCallbacks: Array<() => mixed> | null,
};

export type UpdateQueue<State> = {
  baseState: State,
  firstBaseUpdate: Update<State> | null,
  lastBaseUpdate: Update<State> | null,
  shared: SharedQueue<State>,
  callbacks: Array<() => mixed> | null,
};

export const UpdateState = 0;
export const ReplaceState = 1;
export const ForceUpdate = 2;
export const CaptureUpdate = 3;

```

### V16 
```typescript
export type Update<State> = {
  // The updated expiration time
  expirationTime: ExpirationTime,

  // export const UpdateState = 0;
  // export const ReplaceState = 1;
  // export const ForceUpdate = 2;
  // export const CaptureUpdate = 3;
  // Four states of updates with their own tag numbers
  tag: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3,

  // Updated content. ex: the first argument of `setState`

  payload: any,

  // Callback function. ex: the second argument of `setState`

  callback: (() => mixed) | null,

  // The next update in the queue

  next: Update<State> | null,

  // The priority level of the update, next `side effect`
  nextEffect: Update<State> | null,
};

export type UpdateQueue<State> = {

  // The state after each update
  baseState: State,

  // The first update in the queue
  firstUpdate: Update<State> | null,

  // The last update in the queue
  lastUpdate: Update<State> | null,

  // The first captured update in the queue
  firstCapturedUpdate: Update<State> | null,

  // The last captured update in the queue
  lastCapturedUpdate: Update<State> | null,

  // The first `side effect`
  firstEffect: Update<State> | null,

  // The last `side effect`
  lastEffect: Update<State> | null,

  // The first captured `side effect` and the last
  firstCapturedEffect: Update<State> | null,
  lastCapturedEffect: Update<State> | null,
};
```

#### Changes
1. Both `Update` and `UpdateQueue` are simplified in `V18`. Added `SharedQueue`.
2. `expirationTime` is removed from `Update` and replaced by `lane` in `V18` according to the new `Lane` expression. 
3. Removed all redundant UpdateStates and consolidated them into `lane`/`pending`.
